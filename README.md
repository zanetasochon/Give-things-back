# Welcome to the Give Things Back Projectüëã

The aim of the project is to create a website where everyone can donate unnecessary items to trusted institutions. The website will have a simple form that will make it easier for users to donate items.

## Motivation

Users have items at home that they want to get rid of, but don't know how. There are many solutions available, but many of them require additional effort or there is no trust in them. Verified places require a trip, which people may not have time for or may not be able to go to. Local containers or collections are unverified, and it is unclear whether the items will actually go to those in need.
